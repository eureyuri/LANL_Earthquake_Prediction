## Updates
- Eurey: I found some benchmark code that we could start on but I deicded to checkout what the data was like and test it with RNN + LSTM from our previous project. I have those code in check_data.ipynb, which I haven't finished yet. I also discovered that you can just load some of the data from the csv so I can run the code locally first. Once we know that our prediction is good, we could run it on GCloud. 

## Dependencies
